## Scenario
You are a **cybersecurity analyst** working at a company that specializes in providing IT services for clients. Several customers reported that they were not able to access the client company website `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` and saw the error **“destination port unreachable”** after waiting for the page to load. You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you attempt to visit the website and also receive the error **“destination port unreachable”**. To troubleshoot the issue, you load your network analyzer tool, **tcpdump**, and attempt to load the webpage again. To load the webpage, your browser sends a query to a DNS server via the **UDP protocol** to retrieve the IP address for the website's domain name; this is part of the **DNS protocol**. Your browser then uses this IP address as the destination IP for sending an HTTPS request to the web server to display the webpage. The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets to the DNS server, you receive **ICMP packets** containing the error message: **“udp port 53 unreachable”**.



## Log Analysis from tcpdump Packet Data
In the **tcpdump log**, the first two lines show the initial outgoing request from your computer (**192.51.100.15**) to the DNS server (**203.0.113.2**) requesting the IP address of `yummyrecipesforme.com` via a **UDP packet**. The third and fourth lines show the response to your UDP packet, where the **ICMP 203.0.113.2** line indicates that the UDP packet was undeliverable to **port 53** of the DNS server. In front of each request and response, you find timestamps indicating the incident happened at **13:24:32.192571**. The log displays the source and destination IP addresses, showing the UDP packet traveling from your browser to the DNS server as **192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain**. For the ICMP error response, the source address is **203.0.113.2** and the destination is your computer’s IP address **192.51.100.15**.

Additional details in the first line include the query identification number **35084**. The **plus sign (+)** after this number indicates there are flags associated with the UDP message, and the **"A?"** indicates a flag for a **DNS A record request**. The third line displays the protocol of the response message as **"ICMP"**, followed by the error message **"udp port 53 unreachable"** mentioned in the last line. **Port 53** is the standard port for **DNS service**, and the word **"unreachable"** indicates that the request did not go through because **no service was listening** on the receiving DNS port. The remaining lines in the log show that **ICMP packets** were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times. This event is currently being handled by **security engineers** after being reported to a direct supervisor.

## Report

The UDP protocol reveals that the browser on the host machine (IP 192.51.100.15) sent DNS queries to the DNS server (203.0.113.2) on port 53 to resolve the domain name `www.yummyrecipesforme.com`, but the requests were not delivered to the destination service. This is based on the results of the network analysis, which show that the ICMP message returned the error: `203.0.113.2 udp port 53 is unreachable`. The logs also show a plus sign (+) after the query ID 35084 and an "A?" symbol, which are specific flags for DNS requests. The port noted in the error message is used for DNS requests that translate a domain name into an IP address. The most likely issue is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the DNS provider, which has made the port unreachable, or a firewall configuration problem.

The incident occurred today at **13:24:32.192571** when several customers reported that they could not visit the website and saw the error message: "destination port unreachable". The IT department responded to the problem and repeated the client's actions to reproduce the error, then used the network analysis tool **tcpdump** to capture the traffic. The resulting logs showed that the computer (IP 192.51.100.15) sent UDP packets to the DNS server (203.0.113.2) on port 53, but the server responded with an ICMP error message instead of the requested IP address. This error confirms that the DNS service was not available on the server at that time. Currently, security engineers are investigating the issue to restore access for all users. Our next steps are to check the firewall configuration to see if port 53 is blocked and contact the DNS provider to check for a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack**. The network security team suspects that a DoS attack is the most likely cause of the incident, which made the DNS service stop working.
